# What is Wildfire?
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/15eb5e9a-fcdf-412c-8db1-4ceed8cd7765.jpg)

## The word "wildfire" was burned into my being in April of 2015\. I knew God was preparing me for my year of wildfire. a year later, wildfire is a small nook on the web about healthly living, finding stability, and a place for encouragement. But most importantly, it is the idea that sometimes God uses destruction to makeus fireproof. Through Wildfire, I hope to share real moments, failures, triumphs, and rawness. I pray it is a place Christians, especially women, can come and know that God still has their back, even in the midst of disaster. I desire for the words written in this blog to give you hope when you are down, conviction when there is pride, and serve as a reminder that you are not alone in the struggles you face
