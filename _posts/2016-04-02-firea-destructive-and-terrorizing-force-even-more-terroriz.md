To become fire-proof, the old must die, the ashes must nurture the soil, and life must be born again.'

Fire---a destructive and terrorizing force. Even more terrorizing than this force, is this force without bounds, with no limits or restrictions---wild.Though we have been taught to mourn the ground zero left behind from a wildfire, nature knows that its destruction has purpose: through ruin, new life can grow. All that was old in the previously strangled forest is broken down to its smallest form, soaked and sown into the soil, then stronger, fire-resistant vegetation rises from the ashes of its past. To the unconnected, wildfire is devastating. Yet to those who seek the depths of destruction's meaning, wildfire is the rebirth of all things beautiful. To become fire-proof, the old must die, the ashes must nurture the soil, and life must be born again.
