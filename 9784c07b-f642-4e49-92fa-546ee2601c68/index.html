<p>Awhile back, I had a rambunctious mentor spew out the words “I see you.” It meant so little to who said it because the words belonged to someone much greater… and they were meant to be the first blow to my carefully constructed and fragile self-worth. Somewhere along the way of internalizing the Gospel, I picked up the belief that I was not good enough in raw form. And with that, my value became measurable, meaning I believed <b>I </b>held the power—or weakness—to increase and decrease what I was worth.</p><p>I am not alone in this… behind the curtains, most Christians I have encountered feel inadequate, some are simply better at disguising it. Or, like me, they shroud their negative self-talk with qualities that others view as admirable. This mentality has got the best of some men and women in ministry, both in the church and on the field. We cover up our insecurities by pouring ourselves out too much; we try to be all things to all people. And for me, it was difficult, because on one hand I was doing great and beautiful things for the kingdom, but on the other hand I was leaving little room for God to do the supernatural through me, for the church. I poured out everything I had to realize I had very little Jesus in me… and somewhere along the way, I lost my authentic relationship with Christ while trying to do ministry.</p><picture>

<p>The feeling of “I am not enough” is isolating, it causes us to compare—to divide and judge—ourselves against the people God intends us to unite with. In the loneliness, we take pride in the lie that our “lot” is smaller than others and that through our good deeds we can obtain worth, despite who we are. From our insecurity grows a methodical, intense, and hardworking drive to create a system that measures and tracks what we deem as “worth.” Then, we take on a velocity that moves us towards our man-made goal—the goal that marks the spot where we become good enough. Good enough for ourselves. Enough for the blessings and grace of the Lord. Good enough to be a recipient of the Gospel. We hide our insecure and prideful nature from ourselves and others by disguising it behind otherwise godly desires in which we are secretly measuring our self-worth with.</p><picture>

<p>What is your measuring stick? Is it your finances? Your belongings? How many likes or followers you have? How man carats sit on your finger? How beautiful others think you are? That shrinking number on the scale? How perfect your home looks? No! We are all too spiritually mature to be so vain!</p><p>But let’s go deeper… is your measuring stick your career?  Your marriage?  Your children’s successes … their faith even? What about by how often you pray? How much of the Bible you have read? Or by how often you serve? How many people attend your Bible study? Your position at the church or in the community? Is your success measurable because without your talent, the church would be lacking? Do you measure up well because you believe the church would have a hard-go-at-it if you were to simply walk away? …. Does your measuring stick lie within the opinion of your spouse, child, or parent? Or the opinion of your friends or peers? Of your mentor? Or <i>dare I say it</i>… what your pastor thinks of you?</p><p>Behind the mask we have fooled ourselves with; God says <b><i>“I see you.” </i></b>Do you get it? He <i>sees </i>you. Not your good deeds or failures. Jesus did not die on the cross for your good works. And who you are without Christ is not what defines you. You are loved, deserving of grace, and valuable not because of your works; you were all of these things before your achievements. You were given grace long before your ability to sin.</p><p><b><i>God wrecked me with this truth: “You are enough not because of who you are, but because you are Mine.”</i></b></p><picture>

<p>Right now, right where you are in this moment is enough. God desires us to grow, but our growth is not what defines us. Our self-worth should only be rooted in the loving act of Christ enduring the cross for us. Your worth was created and sealed 2,000 years ago… and to believe anything else is robbing this world from the power and blessings God can reveal through your humble brokenness.</p><p>If you find yourself exhausted by your faith, you must ask yourself “Am I leaving any room for God to work?” So sit back, relax. We are called to live by faith, not by frantically trying to make the kingdom work. When you realize God has got this without you, then he can finally use you!</p><p>My hope in this is that you feel <i>“seen” </i>like I did. He sees how much you care and how you yearn for your father’s approval. And God wants you to rest in the truth that <i><b>you are enough, you always have been enough, and you always will be enough because you were made divine and spotless long before your first breath.</b></i></p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="17"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="18"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="19"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="20"><span data-reactid="21"><!-- react-empty: 22 --><h2 data-reactid="23"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="24"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="25"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="27"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
